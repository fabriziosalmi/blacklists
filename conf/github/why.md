## Why Use This Blacklist?

I'm deeply committed to digital security, and this blacklist reflects that commitment. I use it daily across various devices to continually test and improve its effectiveness.

**How to Use**

- On desktop and laptop computers, easily use it with the uBlock Origin browser extension. Import it as a custom blacklist for instant website unblocking
- On iPhones, it works well with AdGuard Pro for iOS as a custom list
- My setup involves a series of layers for robust protection (uBlock Origin browser extension, PiHole, AdGuard Home as PiHole upstream, Squid proxy)

**Efficient Retrieval**

Fetch the entire blacklist with a simple command:

```
wget https://get.domainsblacklists.com/blacklist.txt
```

**Enhanced Security**

Implementing DNS-level domain blocking improves security and can reduce bandwidth consumption by up to 30%. You can also selectively whitelist domains without compromising overall security.
